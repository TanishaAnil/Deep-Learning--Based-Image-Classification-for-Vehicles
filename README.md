# 🚗 Deep Learning-Based Image Classification for Vehicles

This project uses deep learning techniques to classify different types of vehicles (cars, bikes, buses, trucks, etc.) from images. It involves training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and optionally using transfer learning models like VGG16 to improve accuracy and reduce training time.

## 📌 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to:
- Classify images of vehicles into predefined categories.
- Apply CNNs for feature extraction and classification.
- Utilize transfer learning (VGG16) for performance comparison.
- Visualize performance through plots and confusion matrices.

## 🧠 Model Overview

- Custom CNN: Built using TensorFlow and Keras for end-to-end image classification.
- Transfer Learning: Option to use `VGG16` pre-trained on ImageNet for improved results on small datasets.
- Input shape: Images are resized (e.g., 224x224x3) before being passed to the model.
- Output: Softmax layer for multi-class classification.
